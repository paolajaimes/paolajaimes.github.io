            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Paola Jaimes Santamaria, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Ottawa, expecting to graduate in September 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve conducted research in development economics, the economics of conflict, and natural resources. My work has examined the impact of financial aid programs on crime rates and the social effects of extractive industries in developing countries. This research has provided me with a deep understanding of the dynamics of resource distribution and its influence on conflict, offering valuable insights into economic and social challenges.

Due to my research experience, I have developed advanced skills in data analysis, applied econometrics, and spatial data analysis using tools like Stata, R, and Python. I am also experienced in policy analysis and impact evaluation, which I am eager to apply to real-world problems and contribute to effective policy-making.

In addition to my research, I have extensive teaching experience. I’ve been a teaching assistant for both graduate and undergraduate courses in economics, and I recently taught “Introduction to Development Economics” at the University of Ottawa. I’ve also led short technical courses for second-year PhD students, which has further enhanced my communication and instructional skills.

I’m bilingual in Spanish and English, and I’m actively seeking research positions that focus on policy and program evaluation. I am excited about opportunities that allow me to make a tangible impact through insightful research and analysis.

Let’s connect and collaborate on projects that drive meaningful change in the fields of economics and policy-making!</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
            My research primarily explores themes within Development Economics, Natural Resource and Environmental Economics, and Economics of Conflict. My supervisor is Professor <a href="https://aix1.uottawa.ca/~lhott3/" target="_blank">Louis Hotte</a> at the University of Ottawa.

        <strong>Explaining the 2020 Pandemic Homicide Puzzle: Theory and Evidence</strong> (with <a href="https://aix1.uottawa.ca/~lhott3/">Louis Hotte</a>) <br>
        This paper examines the impact of unemployment benefits during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on violent crimes in the US. Utilizing state month data from the UCR and NIBRS datasets from the FBI, along with unemployment benefits data from the BLS, we explore how economic shocks to low-income families may influence homicide and assault rates. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that some states were much slower than others to send out unemployment supplements. The study includes a Bayesian game model of interpersonal loans and informal enforcement. You can find some fun simulations of a part of the model on my <a href="https://github.com/paolajaimes/GameTheory/blob/main/Zombie%20claims%20model.ipynb" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The draft of this paper is available upon request.

    <strong>Land Conflicts in the Wake of Gold Mining Expansion: A Study on Forced Displacement and Murders of Social Leaders</strong><br>
        This paper investigates the impact of the territorial expansion of legal and illegal gold mining activities in Colombia on violence indicators such as forced displacements, threats, and homicides of social leaders. The study integrates deforestation data and evidence of alluvial gold mining from satellite imagery, along with mining title data from the National Agency of Mining. Employing a 2SLS regression model, the research leverages international gold prices and geochemical gold deposit anomalies as an instrumental variable to analyze the effect of gold mining expansion on violence outcomes from 2001 to 2021. The draft of this paper can be provided upon request.

          <h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>In the Winter 2024 term, I taught "Introduction to Development Economics" at the University of Ottawa. My teaching journey also includes conducting short courses for second-year PhD students at the Ottawa-Carleton Graduate School of Economics (OCGSE). I taught LaTeX workshops in the springs of 2022 and 2023, where I created two practical templates using Overleaf - an <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/pqtnkngyypmm#434cf8" target="_blank">Article Example</a> and a <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tcdfpycfhksp#6b261b" target="_blank">Beamer Presentation Example</a> - to assist students in mastering typesetting for academic research. In the spring of 2024, I developed and taught a 6-hour introductory Stata course. All the materials used for the Stata workshop can be found in the following <a href="https://github.com/paolajaimes/intro-stata-econ/tree/main" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses, emphasizing graduate-level subjects like Economics of Natural Resources and Advanced Microeconomic Theory, along with undergraduate courses such as Introduction to Environmental and Natural Resources Economics, Probability and Statistics, and Financial Econometrics. These experiences have allowed me to support students in navigating complex topics and developing valuable academic skills.</p>
