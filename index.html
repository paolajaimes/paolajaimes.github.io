            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Paola Jaimes Santamaria, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Ottawa (uOttawa) with a focus on development economics, economics of conflict, and natural resources. I am particularly interested in policy evaluation, such as examining the impact of financial aid programs on crime, as well as the social effects of extractive industries in developing countries. My work strives to understand how resource distribution can influence or contribute to conflict, offering insights into key economic and social issues. This term, I'm also teaching a course in Introduction to Development Economics at the University of Ottawa.

            My core skills include data analysis, applied econometrics, and policy evaluation. I aim to apply my skills and expertise to real-world problems and challenges, seeking roles that enable me to make a tangible impact in these fields.</p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p> In the Winter 2024 term, I am excited to teach "Introduction to Development Economics" at the University of Ottawa. My teaching journey includes conducting LaTeX workshops for second-year PhD students, where I created two practical templates using Overleaf - an <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/pqtnkngyypmm#434cf8" target="_blank">Article Example</a> and a <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tcdfpycfhksp#6b261b" target="_blank">Beamer Presentation Example</a>, designed to assist students in mastering typesetting for academic research. Additionally, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses, emphasizing graduate-level subjects like Economics of Natural Resources and Advanced Microeconomic Theory, along with undergraduate courses like Introduction to Environmental and Natural Resources Economics, Probability and Statistics, and Financial Econometrics. These experiences have allowed me to support students in navigating complex topics and develop valuable academic skills.</p>
